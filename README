dep2dot -- generate graph of dependencies

This script takes a set of source files and computes dependency relationships.

The output is a DOT-compliant output that can subsequently be fed into other
utilities, like tred, to more accurately resolve dependencies.

The goal is to support C/C++ source and header files, a la cinclude2dot, but in
the future other languages will be supported.
